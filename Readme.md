# Remake Engine Game Module, The Simpsons Game 2007 (PS3-edition)

This module re-implements *The Simpsons Game* (2007, PS3 edition) using the [RemakeEngine](https://github.com/Superposition28/RemakeEngine). It converts user-provided assets into formats that the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) can use and generates a playable project. To use this module, you must own an original copy of the game.

## Features

- Converts your legally obtained game assets into Godot-ready formats.
- Generates a Godot project using Python and GDScript.
- Requires ownership of the original PlayStation 3 game.

## Goals

- Re-implement the original game logic in GDScript and C#.

## File Breakdown

Here is a breakdown of the key files and directories in this module:

- `Godot/` – Remake logic files.
  - `Godot/Scripts/` – Scene Builder GDScript used to generate game nodes and worlds.
  - `Godot/init.py` – Godot project initializer that generates the project and runs the scene builder.
  - `Godot/scene_config.json` – Defines the location of every in-game asset and what scripts or nodes to attach.
  - `Godot/addons/` – Third-party or custom Godot plugins.
  - `Godot/conf/` – Configuration files for the generated project.
  - `Godot/tests/` – Experimental scenes and scripts for generation testing.
- `indexer/` – Development scripts for generating `PrimaryIndex.db`.
- `Patches/` – Data patches applied to extracted assets (e.g., replacing proprietary UV maps).
- `Scripts/` – Core operation scripts orchestrating the remake process.
- `Stuff/` – Development workspace.
- `operations.json` – Fundamental configuration defining the sequence of asset-processing operations.
- `PathRules.json` – Maps the original nested folder structure into a flatter one.
- `PrimaryIndex.db` – Index of all assets found in the original game.
- `Readme.md` – This file.
- `RenameMap.db` – Maps cryptic original filenames to human-readable names.
- `Tools.json` – Configuration for external tools downloaded by the RemakeEngine.

### Path placeholders

Operations shortcuts generated by `init.py`:

- `{{RemakeEngine.Config.module_path}}` – Path to this module.
- `{{RemakeEngine.Directories.SourcePath}}` – Path to the user's original game files.
- `{{RemakeEngine.Config.project_path}}` – Path to the RemakeEngine root.

This tool is not intended for direct execution; it is fully automated and designed to be executed by [The Remake Engine](https://github.com/Superposition28/RemakeEngine).

All direct dependencies, including Godot, Blender, and QuickBMS, are defined by `Tools.json` and handled by the RemakeEngine. Other dependencies like Python or .NET are not listed or managed. **This module is still in beta.**

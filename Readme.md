# Remake Engine Game Module, The Simpsons Game 2007 (PS3-edition)

A re-implementation tool built using the RemakeEngine

Features
Converts the user-provided game assets into formats usable by Godot.

Goals
Re-implement original game logic in GDScript and GD-C#.

This module contains the Core logics for remaking The Simpsons Game 2007 ps3 game.


## File Breakdown

Here is a breakdown of the key files and directories in this module:


*   **`Godot/`**: Contains the remake logic files
 *   **`Godot/Scripts/`**: contains the Scene Builder GD script used to generate the Game Nodes, world etc in godot
 *   **`Godot/init.py`**: this is the godot project initializer, generates the project and runs the GD scene builder script in godot.
 *   **`Godot/scene_config.json`**: Fundamental Godot game Scene definition file, defines the location of every single in game asset and what nodes to attach what scripts etc. basically the entire game in JSON format..
 *   **`Godot/addons/`**: Contains third-party or custom Godot plugins used by the project
 *   **`Godot/conf/`**: Stores configuration files for the generated Godot project
 *   **`Godot/tests/`**: Experimental scenes and scripts for testing generation


*   **`indexer/`**: dev scripts for generating the PrimaryIndex.db
*   **`Patches/`**: Contains data patches that are applied to the extracted assets to fix issues in extraction, IE: replace proprietary UV maps with community made ones, and assigning mapped textures to assets.. etc
*   **`Scripts/`**: Houses the Core Operation Scripts for Orchestrating the remake process
*   **`Stuff/`**: dev folder
*   **`operations.json`**: The Fundamental configuration file that defines the sequence of operations for processing and converting game assets Used by the RemakeEngine.
*   **`PathRules.json`**: Maps the original gameâ€™s nested folder structure into a more logical, flat structure to reduce redundancy.
*   **`PrimaryIndex.db`**: The main database file that stores an index of all assets found in the original game, generated by the indexer during the dev process, should be accurate unless it was last run after a failed extraction..
*   **`Readme.md`**: This file.
*   **`RenameMap.db`**: A database used to map the original, often cryptic, filenames to more human-readable names for the remake.
*   **`Tools.json`**: Configuration file for external tools required by the asset conversion pipeline, to be Downloaded by the RemakeEngine.
